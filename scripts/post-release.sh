# Increment `versionName` and make it a snapshot
# Incrementing the version name before the release (`bump-version.sh`) sets a
# fixed version until the next release it's made. For testing purposes, it's
# interesting to have a different version name that doesn't match the
# name of the version in production.
# Note that the version must end with a number: `1.2.3-alpha` is a semantic
# version but not compatible with this post-release script.
# and `1.2.3-alpha.0` should be used instead.
