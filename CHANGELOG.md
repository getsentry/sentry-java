## 7.6.0

### Features

- Experimental: Add support for Sentry Developer Metrics ([#3205](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3205), [#3238](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3238), [#3248](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3248), [#3250](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3250))  
  Use the Metrics API to track processing time, download sizes, user signups, and conversion rates and correlate them back to tracing data in order to get deeper insights and solve issues faster. Our API supports counters, distributions, sets, gauges and timers, and it's easy to get started:
  ```kotlin
  Sentry.metrics()
    .increment(
        "button_login_click", // key
        1.0,                  // value
        null,                 // unit
        mapOf(                // tags
            "provider" to "e-mail"
        )
    )
  ```
  To learn more about Sentry Developer Metrics, head over to our [Java](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/metrics/) and [Android](https://docs.sentry.io//platforms/android/metrics/) docs page.

## 7.5.0

### Features

- Add support for measurements at span level ([#3219](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3219))
- Add `enableScopePersistence` option to disable `PersistingScopeObserver` used for ANR reporting which may increase performance overhead. Defaults to `true` ([#3218](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3218))
  - When disabled, the SDK will not enrich ANRv2 events with scope data (e.g. breadcrumbs, user, tags, etc.)
- Configurable defaults for Cron - MonitorConfig ([#3195](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3195))
- We now display a warning on startup if an incompatible version of Spring Boot is detected ([#3233](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3233))
  - This should help notice a mismatching Sentry dependency, especially when upgrading a Spring Boot application
- Experimental: Add Metrics API ([#3205](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3205))

### Fixes

- Ensure performance measurement collection is not taken too frequently ([#3221](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3221))
- Fix old profiles deletion on SDK init ([#3216](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3216))
- Fix hub restore point in wrappers: SentryWrapper, SentryTaskDecorator and SentryScheduleHook ([#3225](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3225))
  - We now reset the hub to its previous value on the thread where the `Runnable`/`Callable`/`Supplier` is executed instead of setting it to the hub that was used on the thread where the `Runnable`/`Callable`/`Supplier` was created.
- Fix add missing thread name/id to app start spans ([#3226](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3226))

## 7.4.0

### Features

- Add new threshold parameters to monitor config ([#3181](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3181))
- Report process init time as a span for app start performance ([#3159](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3159))
- (perf-v2): Calculate frame delay on a span level ([#3197](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3197))
- Resolve spring properties in @SentryCheckIn annotation ([#3194](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3194))
- Experimental: Add Spotlight integration ([#3166](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3166))
    - For more details about Spotlight head over to https://spotlightjs.com/
    - Set `options.isEnableSpotlight = true` to enable Spotlight

### Fixes

- Don't wait on main thread when SDK restarts ([#3200](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3200))
- Fix Jetpack Compose widgets are not being correctly identified for user interaction tracing ([#3209](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3209))
- Fix issue title on Android when a wrapping `RuntimeException` is thrown by the system ([#3212](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3212))
  - This will change grouping of the issues that were previously titled `RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller` to have them split up properly by the original root cause exception

## 7.3.0

### Features

- Added App Start profiling
    - This depends on the new option `io.sentry.profiling.enable-app-start`, other than the already existing `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate`.
    - Sampler functions can check the new `isForNextAppStart` flag, to adjust startup profiling sampling programmatically.
      Relevant PRs:
    - Decouple Profiler from Transaction ([#3101](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3101))
    - Add options and sampling logic ([#3121](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3121))
    - Add ContentProvider and start profile ([#3128](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3128))
- Extend internal performance collector APIs ([#3102](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3102))
- Collect slow and frozen frames for spans using `OnFrameMetricsAvailableListener` ([#3111](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3111))
- Interpolate total frame count to match span duration ([#3158](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3158))

### Fixes

- Avoid multiple breadcrumbs from OkHttpEventListener ([#3175](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3175))
- Apply OkHttp listener auto finish timestamp to all running spans ([#3167](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3167))
- Fix not eligible for auto proxying warnings ([#3154](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3154))
- Set default fingerprint for ANRv2 events to correctly group background and foreground ANRs ([#3164](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3164))
  - This will improve grouping of ANRs that have similar stacktraces but differ in background vs foreground state. Only affects newly-ingested ANR events with `mechanism:AppExitInfo`
- Fix UserFeedback disk cache name conflicts with linked events ([#3116](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3116))

### Breaking changes

- Remove `HostnameVerifier` option as it's flagged by security tools of some app stores ([#3150](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3150))
  - If you were using this option, you have 3 possible paths going forward:
    - Provide a custom `ITransportFactory` through `SentryOptions.setTransportFactory()`, where you can copy over most of the parts like `HttpConnection` and `AsyncHttpTransport` from the SDK with necessary modifications
    - Get a certificate for your server through e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
    - Fork the SDK and add the hostname verifier back

### Dependencies

- Bump Native SDK from v0.6.7 to v0.7.0 ([#3133](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3133))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#070)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.6.7...0.7.0)

## 7.2.0

- Add support for `graphql-java` version 21 ([#3090](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3090))

### Fixes

- Avoid concurrency in AndroidProfiler performance data collection ([#3130](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3130))
- Improve thresholds for network changes breadcrumbs ([#3083](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3083))
- SchedulerFactoryBeanCustomizer now runs first so user customization is not overridden ([#3095](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3095))
  - If you are setting global job listeners please also add `SentryJobListener`
- Ensure serialVersionUID of Exception classes are unique ([#3115](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3115))
- Get rid of "is not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors" warnings in Spring Boot ([#3108](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3108))
- Fix missing `release` and other fields for ANRs reported with `mechanism:AppExitInfo` ([#3074](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3074))

### Dependencies

- Bump `opentelemetry-sdk` to `1.33.0` and `opentelemetry-javaagent` to `1.32.0` ([#3112](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3112))

## 7.1.0

### Features

- Support multiple debug-metadata.properties ([#3024](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3024))
- Automatically downsample transactions when the system is under load ([#3072](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3072))
  - You can opt into this behaviour by setting `enable-backpressure-handling=true`.
  - We're happy to receive feedback, e.g. [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/2829)
  - When the system is under load we start reducing the `tracesSampleRate` automatically.
  - Once the system goes back to healthy, we reset the `tracesSampleRate` to its original value.
- (Android) Experimental: Provide more detailed cold app start information ([#3057](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3057))
  - Attaches spans for Application, ContentProvider, and Activities to app-start timings
  - Application and ContentProvider timings are added using bytecode instrumentation, which requires sentry-android-gradle-plugin version `4.1.0` or newer
  - Uses Process.startUptimeMillis to calculate app-start timings
  - To enable this feature set `options.isEnablePerformanceV2 = true`
- Move slow+frozen frame calculation, as well as frame delay inside SentryFrameMetricsCollector ([#3100](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3100))
- Extract Activity Breadcrumbs generation into own Integration ([#3064](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3064))

### Fixes

- Send breadcrumbs and client error in `SentryOkHttpEventListener` even without transactions ([#3087](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3087))
- Keep `io.sentry.exception.SentryHttpClientException` from obfuscation to display proper issue title on Sentry ([#3093](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3093))
- (Android) Fix wrong activity transaction duration in case SDK init is deferred ([#3092](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3092))

### Dependencies

- Bump Gradle from v8.4.0 to v8.5.0 ([#3070](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3070))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v850)
  - [diff](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/compare/v8.4.0...v8.5.0)

## 7.0.0

Version 7 of the Sentry Android/Java SDK brings a variety of features and fixes. The most notable changes are:
- Bumping `minSdk` level to 19 (Android 4.4)
- The SDK will now listen to connectivity changes and try to re-upload cached events when internet connection is re-established additionally to uploading events on app restart 
- `Sentry.getSpan` now returns the root transaction, which should improve the span hierarchy and make it leaner
- Multiple improvements to reduce probability of the SDK causing ANRs
- New `sentry-okhttp` artifact is unbundled from Android and can be used in pure JVM-only apps

## Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

This SDK version is compatible with a self-hosted version of Sentry `22.12.0` or higher. If you are using an older version of [self-hosted Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) (aka onpremise), you will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/). If you're using `sentry.io` no action is required.

## Sentry Integrations Version Compatibility (Android)

Make sure to align _all_ Sentry dependencies to the same version when bumping the SDK to 7.+, otherwise it will crash at runtime due to binary incompatibility. (E.g. if you're using `-timber`, `-okhttp` or other packages)

For example, if you're using the [Sentry Android Gradle plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin) with the `autoInstallation` [feature](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/configuration/gradle/#auto-installation) (enabled by default), make sure to use version 4.+ of the gradle plugin together with version 7.+ of the SDK. If you can't do that for some reason, you can specify sentry version via the plugin config block:

```kotlin
sentry {
  autoInstallation {
    sentryVersion.set("7.0.0")
  }
}
```

Similarly, if you have a Sentry SDK (e.g. `sentry-android-core`) dependency on one of your Gradle modules and you're updating it to 7.+, make sure the Gradle plugin is at 4.+ or specify the SDK version as shown in the snippet above.

## Breaking Changes

- Bump min API to 19 ([#2883](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2883))
- If you're using `sentry-kotlin-extensions`, it requires `kotlinx-coroutines-core` version `1.6.1` or higher now ([#2838](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2838))
- Move enableNdk from SentryOptions to SentryAndroidOptions ([#2793](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2793))
- Apollo v2 BeforeSpanCallback now allows returning null ([#2890](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2890))
- `SentryOkHttpUtils` was removed from public API as it's been exposed by mistake ([#3005](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3005))
- `Scope` now implements the `IScope` interface, therefore some methods like `ScopeCallback.run` accept `IScope` now ([#3066](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3066))
- Cleanup `startTransaction` overloads ([#2964](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2964))
    - We have reduced the number of overloads by allowing to pass in a `TransactionOptions` object instead of having separate parameters for certain options
    - `TransactionOptions` has defaults set and can be customized, for example:

```kotlin
// old
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("name", "op", bindToScope = true)
// new
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("name", "op", TransactionOptions().apply { isBindToScope = true })
```

## Behavioural Changes

- Android only: `Sentry.getSpan()` returns the root span/transaction instead of the latest span ([#2855](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2855))
- Capture failed HTTP and GraphQL (Apollo) requests by default ([#2794](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2794))
    - This can increase your event consumption and may affect your quota, because we will report failed network requests as Sentry events by default, if you're using the `sentry-android-okhttp` or `sentry-apollo-3` integrations. You can customize what errors you want/don't want to have reported for [OkHttp](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/integrations/okhttp#http-client-errors) and [Apollo3](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/integrations/apollo3#graphql-client-errors) respectively.
- Measure AppStart time till First Draw instead of `onResume` ([#2851](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2851))
- Automatic user interaction tracking: every click now starts a new automatic transaction ([#2891](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2891))
    - Previously performing a click on the same UI widget twice would keep the existing transaction running, the new behavior now better aligns with other SDKs
- Add deadline timeout for automatic transactions ([#2865](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2865))
    - This affects all automatically generated transactions on Android (UI, clicks), the default timeout is 30s, meaning the automatic transaction will be force-finished with status `deadline_exceeded` when reaching the deadline 
- Set ip_address to {{auto}} by default, even if sendDefaultPII is disabled ([#2860](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2860))
    - Instead use the "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" option in the "Security & Privacy" project settings on sentry.io
- Raw logback message and parameters are now guarded by `sendDefaultPii` if an `encoder` has been configured ([#2976](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2976))
- The `maxSpans` setting (defaults to 1000) is enforced for nested child spans which means a single transaction can have `maxSpans` number of children (nested or not) at most ([#3065](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3065))
- The `ScopeCallback` in `withScope` is now always executed ([#3066](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3066))

## Deprecations

- `sentry-android-okhttp` was deprecated in favour of the new `sentry-okhttp` module. Make sure to replace `io.sentry.android.okhttp` package name with `io.sentry.okhttp` before the next major, where the classes will be removed ([#3005](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3005))

## Other Changes

### Features

- Observe network state to upload any unsent envelopes ([#2910](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2910))
    - Android: it works out-of-the-box as part of the default `SendCachedEnvelopeIntegration`
    - JVM: you'd have to install `SendCachedEnvelopeFireAndForgetIntegration` as mentioned in https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/configuration/#configuring-offline-caching and provide your own implementation of `IConnectionStatusProvider` via `SentryOptions`
- Add `sentry-okhttp` module to support instrumenting OkHttp in non-Android projects ([#3005](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3005))
- Do not filter out Sentry SDK frames in case of uncaught exceptions ([#3021](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3021))
- Do not try to send and drop cached envelopes when rate-limiting is active ([#2937](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2937))

### Fixes

- Use `getMyMemoryState()` instead of `getRunningAppProcesses()` to retrieve process importance ([#3004](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3004))
    - This should prevent some app stores from flagging apps as violating their privacy
- Reduce flush timeout to 4s on Android to avoid ANRs ([#2858](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2858))
- Reduce timeout of AsyncHttpTransport to avoid ANR ([#2879](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2879))
- Do not overwrite UI transaction status if set by the user ([#2852](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2852))
- Capture unfinished transaction on Scope with status `aborted` in case a crash happens ([#2938](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2938))
    - This will fix the link between transactions and corresponding crashes, you'll be able to see them in a single trace
- Fix Coroutine Context Propagation using CopyableThreadContextElement ([#2838](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2838))
- Fix don't overwrite the span status of unfinished spans ([#2859](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2859))
- Migrate from `default` interface methods to proper implementations in each interface implementor ([#2847](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2847))
    - This prevents issues when using the SDK on older AGP versions (< 4.x.x)
- Reduce main thread work on init ([#3036](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3036))
- Move Integrations registration to background on init ([#3043](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/3043))
- Fix `SentryOkHttpInterceptor.BeforeSpanCallback` was not finishing span when it was dropped ([#2958](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2958))

- Improve default debouncing mechanism ([#2945](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2945))
- Add `CheckInUtils.withCheckIn` which abstracts away some of the manual check-ins complexity ([#2959](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2959))
- Add `@SentryCaptureExceptionParameter` annotation which captures exceptions passed into an annotated method ([#2764](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2764))
  - This can be used to replace `Sentry.captureException` calls in `@ExceptionHandler` of a `@ControllerAdvice`
- Add `ServerWebExchange` to `Hint` for WebFlux as `WEBFLUX_EXCEPTION_HANDLER_EXCHANGE` ([#2977](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2977))
- Allow filtering GraphQL errors ([#2967](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2967))
  - This list can be set directly when calling the constructor of `SentryInstrumentation`
  - For Spring Boot it can also be set in `application.properties` as `sentry.graphql.ignored-error-types=SOME_ERROR,ANOTHER_ERROR`

### Fixes

- Add OkHttp span auto-close when response body is not read ([#2923](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2923))
- Fix json parsing of nullable/empty fields for Hybrid SDKs ([#2968](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2968))
  - (Internal) Rename `nextList` to `nextListOrNull` to actually match what the method does
  - (Hybrid) Check if there's any object in a collection before trying to parse it (which prevents the "Failed to deserilize object in list" log message)
  - (Hybrid) If a date can't be parsed as an ISO timestamp, attempts to parse it as millis silently, without printing a log message
  - (Hybrid) If `op` is not defined as part of `SpanContext`, fallback to an empty string, because the filed is optional in the spec
- Always attach OkHttp errors and Http Client Errors only to call root span ([#2961](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2961))
- Fixed crash accessing Choreographer instance ([#2970](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2970))

## 6.28.0

### Features

- Add HTTP response code to Spring WebFlux transactions ([#2870](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2870))
- Add `sampled` to Dynamic Sampling Context ([#2869](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2869))
- Improve server side GraphQL support for spring-graphql and Nextflix DGS ([#2856](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2856))
    - If you have already been using `SentryDataFetcherExceptionHandler` that still works but has been deprecated. Please use `SentryGenericDataFetcherExceptionHandler` combined with `SentryInstrumentation` instead for better error reporting.
    - More exceptions and errors caught and reported to Sentry by also looking at the `ExecutionResult` (more specifically its `errors`)
        - You may want to filter out certain errors, please see [docs on filtering](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/configuration/filtering/)
    - More details for Sentry events: query, variables and response (where possible)
    - Breadcrumbs for operation (query, mutation, subscription), data fetchers and data loaders (Spring only)
    - Better hub propagation by using `GraphQLContext`
- Add autoconfigure modules for Spring Boot called `sentry-spring-boot` and `sentry-spring-boot-jakarta` ([#2880](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2880))
  - The autoconfigure modules `sentry-spring-boot` and `sentry-spring-boot-jakarta` have a `compileOnly` dependency on `spring-boot-starter` which is needed for our auto installation in [sentry-android-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin)
  - The starter modules  `sentry-spring-boot-starter` and `sentry-spring-boot-starter-jakarta` now bring `spring-boot-starter` as a dependency
- You can now disable Sentry by setting the `enabled` option to `false` ([#2840](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2840))

### Features

- Add TraceOrigin to Transactions and Spans ([#2803](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2803))

### Fixes

- Deduplicate events happening in multiple threads simultaneously (e.g. `OutOfMemoryError`) ([#2845](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2845))
  - This will improve Crash-Free Session Rate as we no longer will send multiple Session updates with `Crashed` status, but only the one that is relevant
- Ensure no Java 8 method reference sugar is used for Android ([#2857](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2857))
- Do not send session updates for terminated sessions ([#2849](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2849))

- Derive `TracingContext` values from event for ANRv2 events ([#2839](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2839))

## 6.25.2

### Fixes

- Change Spring Boot, Apollo, Apollo 3, JUL, Logback, Log4j2, OpenFeign, GraphQL and Kotlin coroutines core dependencies to compileOnly ([#2837](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2837))

## 6.25.1

### Fixes

- Allow removing integrations in SentryAndroid.init ([#2826](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2826))
- Fix concurrent access to frameMetrics listener ([#2823](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2823))

### Dependencies

- Bump Native SDK from v0.6.4 to v0.6.5 ([#2822](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2822))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#065)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.6.4...0.6.5)
- Bump Gradle from v8.2.0 to v8.2.1 ([#2830](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2830))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v821)
  - [diff](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/compare/v8.2.0...v8.2.1)

## 6.25.0

### Features

- Add manifest `AutoInit` to integrations list ([#2795](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2795))
- Tracing headers (`sentry-trace` and `baggage`) are now attached and passed through even if performance is disabled ([#2788](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2788))

### Fixes

- Set `environment` from `SentryOptions` if none persisted in ANRv2 ([#2809](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2809))
- Remove code that set `tracesSampleRate` to `0.0` for Spring Boot if not set ([#2800](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2800))
  - This used to enable performance but not send any transactions by default.
  - Performance is now disabled by default.
- Fix slow/frozen frames were not reported with transactions ([#2811](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2811))

### Dependencies

- Bump Native SDK from v0.6.3 to v0.6.4 ([#2796](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2796))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#064)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.6.3...0.6.4)
- Bump Gradle from v8.1.1 to v8.2.0 ([#2810](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2810))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v820)
  - [diff](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/compare/v8.1.1...v8.2.0)

## 6.24.0

### Features

- Add debouncing mechanism and before-capture callbacks for screenshots and view hierarchies ([#2773](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2773))
- Improve ANRv2 implementation ([#2792](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2792))
  - Add a proguard rule to keep `ApplicationNotResponding` class from obfuscation
  - Add a new option `setReportHistoricalAnrs`; when enabled, it will report all of the ANRs from the [getHistoricalExitReasons](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager?hl=en#getHistoricalProcessExitReasons(java.lang.String,%20int,%20int)) list. 
  By default, the SDK only reports and enriches the latest ANR and only this one counts towards ANR rate. 
  Worth noting that this option is mainly useful when updating the SDK to the version where ANRv2 has been introduced, to report all ANRs happened prior to the SDK update. After that, the SDK will always pick up the latest ANR from the historical exit reasons list on next app restart, so there should be no historical ANRs to report.
  These ANRs are reported with the `HistoricalAppExitInfo` mechanism.
  - Add a new option `setAttachAnrThreadDump` to send ANR thread dump from the system as an attachment. 
  This is only useful as additional information, because the SDK attempts to parse the thread dump into proper threads with stacktraces by default.
  - If [ApplicationExitInfo#getTraceInputStream](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo#getTraceInputStream()) returns null, the SDK no longer reports an ANR event, as these events are not very useful without it.
  - Enhance regex patterns for native stackframes

## 6.23.0

### Features

- Add profile rate limiting ([#2782](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2782))
- Support for automatically capturing Failed GraphQL (Apollo 3) Client errors ([#2781](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2781))

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .sentryTracing(captureFailedRequests = true)    
    .build()
```

### Dependencies

- Bump Native SDK from v0.6.2 to v0.6.3 ([#2746](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2746))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#063)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.6.2...0.6.3)

### Fixes

- Align http.status with [span data conventions](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-data-conventions/) ([#2786](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2786))

## 6.22.0

### Features

- Add `lock` attribute to the `SentryStackFrame` protocol to better highlight offending frames in the UI ([#2761](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2761))
- Enrich database spans with blocked main thread info ([#2760](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2760))
- Add `api_target` to `Request` and `data` to `Response` Protocols ([#2775](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2775))

### Fixes

- No longer use `String.join` in `Baggage` as it requires API level 26 ([#2778](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2778))

## 6.21.0

### Features

- Introduce new `sentry-android-sqlite` integration ([#2722](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2722))
    - This integration replaces the old `androidx.sqlite` database instrumentation in the Sentry Android Gradle plugin
    - A new capability to manually instrument your `androidx.sqlite` databases. 
      - You can wrap your custom `SupportSQLiteOpenHelper` instance into `SentrySupportSQLiteOpenHelper(myHelper)` if you're not using the Sentry Android Gradle plugin and still benefit from performance auto-instrumentation.
- Add SentryWrapper for Callable and Supplier Interface ([#2720](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2720))
- Load sentry-debug-meta.properties ([#2734](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2734))
  - This enables source context for Java
  - For more information on how to enable source context, please refer to [#633](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/633#issuecomment-1465599120)

### Fixes

- Finish WebFlux transaction before popping scope ([#2724](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2724))
- Use daemon threads for SentryExecutorService ([#2747](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2747))
  - We started using `SentryExecutorService` in `6.19.0` which caused the application to hang on shutdown unless `Sentry.close()` was called. By using daemon threads we no longer block shutdown.
- Use Base64.NO_WRAP to avoid unexpected char errors in Apollo ([#2745](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2745))
- Don't warn R8 on missing `ComposeViewHierarchyExporter` class ([#2743](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2743))

## 6.20.0

### Features

- Add support for Sentry Kotlin Compiler Plugin ([#2695](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2695))
  - In conjunction with our sentry-kotlin-compiler-plugin we improved Jetpack Compose support for
    - [View Hierarchy](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/) support for Jetpack Compose screens
    - Automatic breadcrumbs for [user interactions](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-instrumentation)
- More granular http requests instrumentation with a new SentryOkHttpEventListener ([#2659](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2659))
    - Create spans for time spent on:
        - Proxy selection
        - DNS resolution
        - HTTPS setup
        - Connection
        - Requesting headers
        - Receiving response
    - You can attach the event listener to your OkHttpClient through `client.eventListener(new SentryOkHttpEventListener()).addInterceptor(new SentryOkHttpInterceptor()).build();`
    - In case you already have an event listener you can use the SentryOkHttpEventListener as well through `client.eventListener(new SentryOkHttpEventListener(myListener)).addInterceptor(new SentryOkHttpInterceptor()).build();`
- Add a new option to disable `RootChecker` ([#2735](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2735))

### Fixes

- Base64 encode internal Apollo3 Headers ([#2707](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2707))
- Fix `SentryTracer` crash when scheduling auto-finish of a transaction, but the timer has already been cancelled ([#2731](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2731))
- Fix `AndroidTransactionProfiler` crash when finishing a profile that happened due to race condition ([#2731](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2731))

## 6.19.1

### Fixes

- Ensure screenshots and view hierarchies are captured on the main thread ([#2712](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2712))

## 6.19.0

### Features

- Add Screenshot and ViewHierarchy to integrations list ([#2698](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2698))
- New ANR detection based on [ApplicationExitInfo API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo) ([#2697](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2697))
    - This implementation completely replaces the old one (based on a watchdog) on devices running Android 11 and above:
      - New implementation provides more precise ANR events/ANR rate detection as well as system thread dump information. The new implementation reports ANRs exactly as Google Play Console, without producing false positives or missing important background ANR events.
      - New implementation reports ANR events with a new mechanism `mechanism:AppExitInfo`.
      - However, despite producing many false positives, the old implementation is capable of better enriching ANR errors (which is not available with the new implementation), for example:
        - Capturing screenshots at the time of ANR event;
        - Capturing transactions and profiling data corresponding to the ANR event;
        - Auxiliary information (such as current memory load) at the time of ANR event.
      - If you would like us to provide support for the old approach working alongside the new one on Android 11 and above (e.g. for raising events for slow code on main thread), consider upvoting [this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/2693).
    - The old watchdog implementation will continue working for older API versions (Android < 11):
        - The old implementation reports ANR events with the existing mechanism `mechanism:ANR`.
- Open up `TransactionOptions`, `ITransaction` and `IHub` methods allowing consumers modify start/end timestamp of transactions and spans ([#2701](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2701))
- Send source bundle IDs to Sentry to enable source context ([#2663](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2663))
  - For more information on how to enable source context, please refer to [#633](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/633#issuecomment-1465599120)

### Fixes

- Android Profiler on calling thread ([#2691](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2691))
- Use `configureScope` instead of `withScope` in `Hub.close()`. This ensures that the main scope releases the in-memory data when closing a hub instance. ([#2688](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2688))
- Remove null keys/values before creating concurrent hashmap in order to avoid NPE ([#2708](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2708))
- Exclude SentryOptions from R8/ProGuard obfuscation ([#2699](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2699))
  - This fixes AGP 8.+ incompatibility, where full R8 mode is enforced

- The Spring Boot integration can now be configured to add the `SentryAppender` to specific loggers instead of the `ROOT` logger ([#2173](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2173))
  - You can specify the loggers using `"sentry.logging.loggers[0]=foo.bar` and `"sentry.logging.loggers[1]=baz` in your `application.properties`
- Add capabilities to track Jetpack Compose composition/rendering time ([#2507](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2507))

### Fixes

- Fix timestamps of slow and frozen frames for profiles ([#2584](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2584))
- Deprecate reportFullDisplayed in favor of reportFullyDisplayed ([#2585](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2585))
- Add mechanism for logging integrations and update spring mechanism types ([#2595](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2595))
	- NOTE: If you're using these mechanism types (`HandlerExceptionResolver`, `SentryWebExceptionHandler`) in your dashboards please update them to use the new types.
- Filter out session cookies sent by Spring and Spring Boot integrations ([#2593](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2593))
  - We filter out some common cookies like JSESSIONID
  - We also read the value from `server.servlet.session.cookie.name` and filter it out
- No longer send event / transaction to Sentry if `beforeSend` / `beforeSendTransaction` throws ([#2591](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2591))
- Add version to sentryClientName used in auth header ([#2596](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2596))

  - The log message was often not visible as our docs suggest a minimum log level of WARN
- Fix session tracking on Android ([#2609](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2609))
  - Incorrect number of session has been sent. In addition, some of the sessions were not properly ended, messing up Session Health Metrics.

### Dependencies

- Bump `opentelemetry-sdk` to `1.23.1` and `opentelemetry-javaagent` to `1.23.0` ([#2590](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2590))

  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.5.4...0.6.0)

## 6.15.0

### Features

- Adjust time-to-full-display span if reportFullDisplayed is called too early ([#2550](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2550))
- Add `enableTracing` option ([#2530](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2530))
    - This change is backwards compatible. The default is `null` meaning existing behaviour remains unchanged (setting either `tracesSampleRate` or `tracesSampler` enables performance).
    - If set to `true`, performance is enabled, even if no `tracesSampleRate` or `tracesSampler` have been configured.
    - If set to `false` performance is disabled, regardless of `tracesSampleRate` and `tracesSampler` options.
- Detect dependencies by listing MANIFEST.MF files at runtime ([#2538](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2538))
- Report integrations in use, report packages in use more consistently ([#2179](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2179))
- Implement `ThreadLocalAccessor` for propagating Sentry hub with reactor / WebFlux ([#2570](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2570))
  - Requires `io.micrometer:context-propagation:1.0.2+` as well as Spring Boot 3.0.3+
  - Enable the feature by setting `sentry.reactive.thread-local-accessor-enabled=true`
  - This is still considered experimental. Once we have enough feedback we may turn this on by default.
  - Checkout the sample here: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/main/sentry-samples/sentry-samples-spring-boot-webflux-jakarta
  - A new hub is now cloned from the main hub for every request

### Fixes

- Leave `inApp` flag for stack frames undecided in SDK if unsure and let ingestion decide instead ([#2547](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2547))
- Allow `0.0` error sample rate ([#2573](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2573))
- Fix memory leak in WebFlux related to an ever growing stack ([#2580](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2580))
- Use the same hub in WebFlux exception handler as we do in WebFilter ([#2566](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2566))
- Switch upstream Jetpack Compose dependencies to `compileOnly` in `sentry-compose-android` ([#2578](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2578))
  - NOTE: If you're using Compose Navigation/User Interaction integrations, make sure to have the following dependencies on the classpath as we do not bring them in transitively anymore:
    - `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:`
    - `androidx.compose.runtime:runtime:`
    - `androidx.compose.ui:ui:`

  - Capture breadcrumbs for level INFO and higher
  - Raises event for ERROR and higher.
  - Minimum levels are configurable.
  - Optionally initializes the SDK via appender.xml
  - Configurable via Spring integration if both are enabled
- Spring
  - No more duplicate events with Spring and logback
  - Auto initalizes if DSN is available
  - Configuration options available with auto complete
- Google App Engine support dropped

1) To add integrations it requires a [manual initialization](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/#manual-initialization) of the Android SDK.

2) Add the `sentry-android-timber` dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-android-timber:{version}' // version >= 2.2.0
```

3) Initialize and add the `SentryTimberIntegration`:

```java
SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
    // default values:
    // minEventLevel = ERROR
    // minBreadcrumbLevel = INFO
    options.addIntegration(new SentryTimberIntegration());

    // custom values for minEventLevel and minBreadcrumbLevel
    // options.addIntegration(new SentryTimberIntegration(SentryLevel.WARNING, SentryLevel.ERROR));
});
```

4) Use the Timber integration:

```java
try {
    int x = 1 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    Timber.e(e);
}
```
