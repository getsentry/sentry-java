## Java + Android

This release marks the re-unification of Java and Android SDK code bases.
It's based on the Android 2.0 SDK, which implements [Sentry's unified API](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/unified-api/).

Considerable changes were done, which include a lot of improvements. More are covered below, but the highlights are:

* Improved `log4j2` integration
  * Capture breadcrumbs for level INFO and higher
  * Raises event for ERROR and higher.
  * Minimum levels are configurable.
  * Optionally initializes the SDK via appender.xml
* Dropped support to `log4j`.
* Improved `logback` integration
  * Capture breadcrumbs for level INFO and higher
  * Raises event for ERROR and higher. 
  * Minimum levels are configurable.
  * Optionally initializes the SDK via appender.xml
  * Configurable via Spring integration if both are enabled
* Spring
  * No more duplicate events with Spring and logback
  * Auto initalizes if DSN is available
  * Configuration options available with auto complete
* Google App Engine support dropped

## What’s Changed

* Callback to validate SSL certificate (#944) 
* Attach stack traces enabled by default

### Android specific

* Release health enabled by default for Android
* Sync of Scopes for Java -> Native (NDK)
* Bump Sentry-Native v0.4.2
* Android 11 Support

[Android migration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-sentry-android-2x-to-sentry-android-3x)

### Java specific

* Unified API for Java SDK and integrations (Spring, Spring boot starter, Servlet, Logback, Log4j2)

New Java [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/) are live and being improved.

* feat: timber integration (#464) @marandaneto

1) To add integrations it requires a [manual initialization](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/#manual-initialization) of the Android SDK.

2) Add the `sentry-android-timber` dependency:

```groovy
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-android-timber:{version}' // version >= 2.2.0
```

3) Initialize and add the `SentryTimberIntegration`:

```java
SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
    // default values:
    // minEventLevel = ERROR
    // minBreadcrumbLevel = INFO
    options.addIntegration(new SentryTimberIntegration());

    // custom values for minEventLevel and minBreadcrumbLevel
    // options.addIntegration(new SentryTimberIntegration(SentryLevel.WARNING, SentryLevel.ERROR));
});
```

4) Use the Timber integration:

```java
try {
    int x = 1 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    Timber.e(e);
}
```

Packages were released on [`bintray`](https://dl.bintray.com/getsentry/sentry-android/io/sentry/sentry-android/), [`jcenter`](https://jcenter.bintray.com/io/sentry/sentry-android/) and [`mavenCentral`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/sentry/sentry-android/)
