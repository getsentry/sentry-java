# raven-java

Raven is the Java SDK for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). It provides out-of-the-box support for
many popular JVM based frameworks and libraries, including Android, Log4j, Logback, and more.

In most cases using one of the existing integrations is preferred, but Raven additionally provides
a low level client for manually building and sending events to Sentry that can be used in any JVM
based application.
