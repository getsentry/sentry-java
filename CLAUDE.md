## STOP — Required Reading (Do This First)

Before doing ANYTHING else (including answering questions), you MUST use the Read tool to load [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and follow ALL of its instructions, including reading the required `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files it references.

Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT proceed without reading these files first.
