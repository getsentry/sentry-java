# Sentry Spring Boot integration

This integration is ideal to Spring Boot users. It buids on top of [Sentry's core Java SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java)
and also integrates well with logback or log4j2 if those are used in the application.

For more information check out [Sentry Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/).
