# Java SDK OpenTelemetry Integration

## Overview

The Sentry Java SDK provides comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration through multiple modules:

- `sentry-opentelemetry-core`: Core OpenTelemetry integration functionality
- `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`: Java Agent-based integration for automatic instrumentation
- `sentry-opentelemetry-agentless`: Manual instrumentation without Java agent
- `sentry-opentelemetry-agentless-spring`: Spring-specific agentless integration
- `sentry-opentelemetry-bootstrap`: Classes that go into the bootstrap classloader when the agent is used. For agentless they are simply used in the applications classloader.
- `sentry-opentelemetry-agentcustomization`: Classes that help wire up Sentry in OpenTelemetry. These land in the agent classloader when the agent is used. For agentless they are simply used in the application classloader.
- `sentry-opentelemetry-otlp`: Classes for using OpenTelemetry to send spans to Sentry using the OTLP endpoint and have Sentry use OpenTelemetry trace and span id.

## Advantages over using Sentry without OpenTelemetry

- Support for more libraries and frameworks
    - See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation for a list of supported libraries and frameworks
- More automated Performance instrumentation (spans) created
    - Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` offers most support
    - Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agentless-spring` for Spring Boot also has a lot of supported libraries, altough fewer than the agent does
    - Note that `sentry-opentelemetry-agentless` will not have any OpenTelemetry auto instrumentation
- Sentry also relies on OpenTelemetry `Context` propagation to propagate Sentry `Scopes`, ensuring e.g. that execution flow for a request shares data and does not leak data into other requests.
- OpenTelemetry also offers better support for distributed tracing since more libraries are supported for attaching tracing information to outgoing requests and picking up incoming tracing information.

## Key Components

### Agent vs Agentless

**Java Agent-based integration**:
- Automatic instrumentation via Java agent
- Can be added to any JAR when starting, no extra dependencies or code changes required. Just add the agent when running the application, e.g. `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE=sentry.properties JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-javaagent:sentry-opentelemetry-agent.jar" java -jar your-application.jar`.
- Uses OpenTelemetry Java agent with Sentry extensions
- Uses bytecode manipulation

**Agentless-Spring integration**:
- Automatic instrumentation setup via Spring Boot
- Dependency needs to be added to the project.

**Agentless integration**:
- Manual instrumentation setup
- Dependency needs to be added to the project.

**Manual Integration**:
While it's possible to manually wire up all the required classes to make Sentry and OpenTelemetry work together, we do not recommend this.
It is instead preferrable to use `SentryAutoConfigurationCustomizerProvider` so the Sentry SDK has a place to manage required classes and update it when changes are needed.
This way customers receive the updated config automatically as oppposed to having to update manually, wire in new classes, remove old ones etc.

### Integration Architecture

Sentry will try to locate certain classes that come with the Sentry OpenTelemetry integration to:
- Determine whether any Sentry OpenTelemetry integration is present
- Determine which mode to use and in turn which Sentry auto instrumentation to suppress

Reflection is used to search for `io.sentry.opentelemetry.OtelContextScopesStorage` and use it instead of `DefaultScopesStorage` when a Sentry OpenTelemetry integration is present at runtime. `IScopesStorage` is used to store Sentry `Scopes` instances. `DefaultScopesStorage` will use a thread local variable to store the current threads' `Scopes` whereas `OtelContextScopesStorage` makes use of OpenTelemetry SDKs `Context`. Sentry OpenTelemetry integrations configure OpenTelemetry to use `SentryOtelThreadLocalStorage` to customize restoring of the previous `Context`.

OpenTelemetry SDK makes use of `io.opentelemetry.context.Scope` in `try-with-resources` statements that call `close` when a code block is finished. Without customization, it would refuse to restore the previous `Context` onto the `ThreadLocal` if the current state of the `ThreadLocal` isn't the same as the one this scope was created for. Sentry changes this behaviour in `SentryScopeImpl` to restore the previous `Context` onto the `ThreadLocal` even if an inner `io.opentelemetry.context.Scope` wasn't properly cleaned up. Our thinking here is to prefer returning to a clean state as opposed to propagating the problem. The unclean state could happen, if `io.opentelemetry.context.Scope` isn't closed, e.g. when forgetting to put it in a `try-with-resources` statement and not calling `close` (e.g. not putting it in a `finally` block in that case).

`SentryContextStorageProvider` looks for any other `ContextStorageProvider` and forwards to that to not override any customized `ContextStorage`. If no other provider is found, `SentryOtelThreadLocalStorage` is used.

`SpanFactoryFactory` is used to configure Sentry to use `io.sentry.opentelemetry.OtelSpanFactory` if the class is present at runtime. Reflection is used to search for it. If the class is not available, we fall back to `DefaultSpanFactory`.

`DefaultSpanFactory` creates a `SentryTracer` instance when creating a transaction and spans are then created directly on the transaction via `startChild`.
`OtelSpanFactory` instead creates an OpenTelemetry span and wraps it using `OtelTransactionSpanForwarder` to simulate a transaction. The `startChild` invocations on `OtelTransactionSpanForwarder` go through `OtelSpanFactory` again to create the child span.

## Configuration

We use `SentryAutoConfigurationCustomizerProvider` to configure OpenTelemetry for use with Sentry and register required classes, hooks etc.

## Span Processing

Both Sentry and OpenTelemetry API can be used to create spans. When using Sentry API, `OtelSpanFactory` is used to indirectly create a OpenTelemetry span.
Regardless of API used, when an OpenTelemetry span is created, it goes through `SentrySampler` for sampling and `OtelSentrySpanProcessor` for `Scopes` forking and ensuring the trace is continued.
When Sentry API is used, sampling is performed in `Scopes.createTransaction` before forwarding the call to `OtelSpanFactory`. The sampling decision and other sampling details are forwarded to `SentrySampler` and `OtelSentrySpanProcessor`.

When a span is finished, regardless of whether Sentry or OpenTelemetry API is used, it goes through `OtelSentrySpanProcessor` to set the end date and then through `BatchSpanProcessor` which will batch spans and then forward them to `SentrySpanExporter`.

`SentrySpanExporter` collects spans, then structures them to create a transaction for the local root span and attaches child spans to form a span tree.
Some OpenTelemetry attributes are transformed into their corresponding Sentry data structure or format.

After creating the transaction with child spans `SentrySpanExporter` uses Sentry API to send the transaction to Sentry. This API call however forces the use of `DefaultSpanFactory` in order to create the required Sentry classes for sending and also to not create an infinite loop where any span created will cause a new span to be created recursively.

## Troubleshooting

To debug forking of `Scopes`, we added a reference to `parent` `Scopes` and a `creator` String to store the reason why `Scopes` were created or forked.

# OTLP
When using `sentry-opentelemetry-otlp`, Sentry only loads trace ID and span ID from OpenTelemetry `Context` (via `OpenTelemetryOtlpEventProcessor`). Sentry does not rely on OpenTelemetry `Context` for scope storage and propagation, instead relying on its `DefaultScopesStorage`.
It is common to keep Performance in Sentry SDK disabled since that part is taken over by OpenTelemetry.
The `sentry-opentelemetry-otlp` module is not connected to the other `sentry-opentelemetry-*` modules but instead intended only when the goal is to run OpenTelemetry for creating spans and Sentry for other products like errors, logs, metrics etc.
The OTLP module does not easily work with the OpenTelemetry agent as it would require customizing the agent.JAR in order to get the propagator loaded.
