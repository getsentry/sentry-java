# Java SDK Feature Flags

There is a scope based and a span based API for tracking feature flag evaluations.

## Scope Based API

The `addFeatureFlag` method can be used to track feature flag evaluations. It exists on `Sentry` static API as well as `IScopes` and `IScope`.

The `maxFeatureFlags` option controls how many flags are tracked per scope and also how many are sent to Sentry as part of events.
Scope based feature flags can also be disabled by setting the value to 0. Defaults to 100 feature flag evaluations.

Order of feature flag evaluations is important as we only keep track of the last {maxFeatureFlag} items.

When a feature flag evluation with the same name is added, the previous one is removed and the new one is stored so that it'll be dropped last.

When sending out an error event, feature flag buffers from all three scope types (global, isolation and current scope) are merged, chosing the newest {maxFeatureFlag} entries across all scope types. Feature flags are sent as part of the `flags` context.
