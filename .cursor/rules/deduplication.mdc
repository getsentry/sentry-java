# Java SDK Event deduplication

To avoid sending the same error multiple times, there is deduplication logic in place in the SDK.
Duplicate captures can happen due to multiple integrations capturing the exception as well as additional manual calls to `Sentry.captureException`.

Deduplication is performed in `DuplicateEventDetectionEventProcessor` which returns `null` when it detects a duplicate event causing it to be dropped.

The `enableDeduplication` option can be used to opt out of deduplication. It is enabled by default.
